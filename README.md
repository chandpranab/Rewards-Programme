# Rewards Program React App

This app demonstrates the implementation of **Rewards Program** app using React JS.

## Problem Statement

```
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
```
